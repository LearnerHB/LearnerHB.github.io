<h2 id="Reasons-for"><a href="#Reasons-for" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for"></a>Reasons for</h2><p>- </p>
<p>In my first year at Xiamen University majoring in Oceanography, I would never have thought that my fortuitous participation in the Contest of Robotic Innovations could greatly change my academic path. I witnessed the magical power of programming and data processing, turning my ideas into reality, which motivated me to go further study. With strong determination, I passed an exam that allowed me to change my major to computer science and technology. After two work experiences, I became extremely comfortable working with the companies’ various operations, processes, and data flows. More importantly, I learned how data science changes the way the enterprises’ functions operate, and how it is changing the way engineering is conducted. By attending programs in Singapore and Taiwan. I connected with the world and explored data science trends in the global market. This inspired me to greater efforts. My intentions are to stay in tune with the constant evolution of data science and to use it for the betterment of society. With so many rich learning experiences behind me, I am now keener to study in a city that is characterised by innovation and openness. As one of the fastest-growing cities in the world and a leading global technology hub, Shenzhen is my number one choice. The Chinese University of Hong Kong University, Shenzhen is a vibrant university with a soaring reputation in data science. The unique collegiate system, which enables students from various academic and cultural backgrounds to form a closer relationship with each other, is so attractive to me. Equipping students with methodologies and models for developing solutions to Big Data analysis in various areas, and focusing on both the study of professional knowledge and the cultivation of practical ability, the MSc in Data Science Programme (Big Data Analysis concentration) is definitely the best choice for me.</p>

<p><strong>9.MOTIVATION FOR APPLICATION AND CAREER GOALS</strong> </p>
<p><strong>9.1 Data Science and Machine Learning</strong></p>
<p>Data science is the most sexiest thing in the world. I have been studying data science by myself for more than one year. Since I major in computer science and technology, I do a lot of programming and data processing. I love to analyze problems with the help of data using methods like machine learning, neural network or any other ways. It is so charming to better know the world by processing data. I want to be a data scientist in the future. I want to make good use of data and make the world a better place. The curriculum of this programme is so attractive to me. I believe I can learn a lot from it and get closer to my dream job. </p>

<p><strong>9.2 Industry 4.0</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.3 NTU - KM</strong></p>
<p>Work Assignment </p>
<p>2019-3 - 2019.6<br>I started my first internship as an information technology engineer at the Agricultural Bank of China in March 2019. My responsibilities included using the bank’s Taihang management system to extract the cash flow and loan history of clients, and building a model that could generate their credit rating based on large amounts of data. </p>
<p>2019.7 - 2019.8<br>I later interned as an algorithm engineer at UCAR, China’s largest online car rental platform. There, I applied the Mask R-CNN framework to process the pictures of thousands of cars that were damaged in collisions. After many model optimisations, we were able to identify the various impacts and determine the amount of compensation due. </p>
<p><strong>9.4 NUS ISS</strong></p>
<p><strong>project undertook in the last 5 years</strong></p>
<p>2017.07 Contest of Robotic Innovations at Xiamen University<br>My teammates and I completed the design of an intelligent car which processes the data returned by the sensor as well as realizes automatic tracking and obstacle counting. We won the third prize. </p>
<p>2017.09 China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modelling<br>The problems we encountered was determining the optimal material-processing order. I took the lead and subdivided the problem into three sub-systems, including a time-management system, a scoring system and a decision-making system. We independently encoded each possible material-processing scheme, took the total processing time as the objective function, and used the idea of a genetic algorithm to quickly screen out the scheme with the fastest processing speed. We won first prize in the Fujian province section. I was awarded an Academic Innovation Scholarship for my endeavours.</p>
<p>2019.02-2019.06 Agriculture Bank of China – I.T. Engineer Intern<br>Graded selected corporate clients by utilizing Machine Learning technology, based on the cash flow and loan history of these clients, and adjusted credit limit by the grade of clients, saving the labour cost of 1.5 full-time employees.</p>
<p>2019.07- Exploring New Space Technologies and Applications<br>NUS - Innovation Design Programme. Designed the satellite model (including the hardware logic operations of the Inter-computer) used for automatically detecting shale gas leakages in the ground by processing data returned from the infrared sensor. Calculated the parameters interval in the normal operation of the satellite model to simulate satellite operations with an STK simulating system. </p>
<p>2019.07-2019.08 Ucar Inc. - Algorithm Engineer Intern<br>UCAR, Internet company, China’s largest online car rental platform. I applied the Mask R-CNN framework to process 3,000 car damage pictures, including scratch, deformation and indenture. Optimized and released the car damage detection model for 3 versions, marked out damaged areas with 95% accuracy rate, and determined the amount of compensation due to car renters. </p>
<p>2019.11-2019.12 Theater siting based on machine learning method<br>IBM Data Science Course Project. I used Google Maps API to query the detailed information of theatres in major cities in Taiwan. Then with the FourSquare plug-in, I obtained information about public facilities around each theatre and used it as features which could have influenced the popularity of each theatre. The popularity of each theatre, which could be represented by the number of comments to this theatre, was seen as the target of our model. After dataset splitting, feature engineering, machine learning model selecting, model fitting and a few times of model optimization, I got the model with the least mean square error on testing data. Then use this to predict the popularity of candidate locations and determine the final theatre siting.</p>
<p><strong>professional objectives</strong><br>Pursuing your programme helps me to sharpen my skills in pattern recognition and vision system design. I will learn more about how to build a high-quality intelligent system using state-of-the-art technologies. I could also be together with many of the most excellent partners and get guidance from the best intelligent systems experts in the world. After completing this programme, I will find a job in a company focusing on intelligent system designing like a self-driving car, and apply what I have learned into it. I would devote myself to the field of intelligent systems, become an expert and try my best to provide intelligent solutions for the transformation of traditional industries.</p>
